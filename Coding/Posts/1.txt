Photos by @alessandro.cinque | The provinces of Esmeralda and Carchi in Ecuador were once rich in native fauna and flora; now they're increasingly deforested by oil palm monoculture. One of the faces of the resistance to the crop in the region is Dona Julia, 61, from Quininde. She never wanted to sell her land to the multinational corporations like most of her neighbors, and she's been able to support her family with cacao cultivation on 21 hectares (51 acres) as part of a local farm cooperative.Dona Julia (above) also founded an organization of women who run a workshop (9th photo) for making chocolate that's sold across Ecuador. She's helped by her husband, Rosendo Evaristo Moran (8th photo), who was injured while working on a palm plantation. Photos two and three show a palm plantation and workers. In photo four, Dona Julia crosses the river to get to her cacao plantation. Two following images detail the cacao process.To see more of my work, please follow @alessandro.cinque.
